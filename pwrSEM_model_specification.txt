model specification for Emmy Noether Grant 2024 for pwrSEM power caluclation.
Note, the model is based on a strcutural equation model.

See, "pwrSEM parameter values" for an overview of input parameters

#measurement model
LC =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 # LC-NE functioning in 4 tasks
PSY =~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 # psychopathology by 6 indicators

# regressions
LC ~ PSY

# factor variances
LC ~~ LC 
PSY ~~ PSY
            
# manifest variances for X (made equivalent by naming theta1)
x1 ~~ theta1*x1
x2 ~~ theta1*x2
x3 ~~ theta1*x3
x4 ~~ theta1*x4
x5 ~~ theta1*x5
x6 ~~ theta1*x6

# manifest variances for Y (made equivalent by naming theta2)
y1 ~~ theta2*y1
y2 ~~ theta2*y2
y3 ~~ theta2*y3
y4 ~~ theta2*y4
